      <description>&lt;p&gt;This application was built for Natural Language Processing Centre of University of Moratuwa. The client had a very large data corpus and there were some erroneous tags for the words. A tag is basically the type of the word like abbreviation, full stop, adjectival noun, postpositions, pronouns etc (There are around 30 tags). It was required to change the tag according to the position of the word in a single sentence or change the tag of the selected word for the whole corpus. Usability and consistency were the main considerations of the application. So different methods were added to search the content like searching by word and searching by tag. The editor can be configured to and corpus with the same corpus conventions and the changes are consistently saved in the file system.&lt;/p&gt;
